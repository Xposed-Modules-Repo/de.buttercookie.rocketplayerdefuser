# Rocket Player Timebomb Defuser
For unfathomable and annoying reasons, at some point the developer of Rocket Player apparently
added a timebomb to his app, which appears at a certain point in time after the build date of the
app and puts up an unskippable dialog directing you to the Play Store to update the app.

Even more annoyingly, in 2022 he sold Rocket Player to some dubious firm that, if current Play Store
reviews are anything to go by, has stopped honouring the old paid "Rocket Unlocker" and instead
demands an in-app subscription for the cheap price of 19.99 â‚¬ per month, or something like that.

It so happens that one of the last versions of Rocket Player that was presumably built by the original
developer before the sale (5.18.60) has an expiration date on January 4, 2024, which, as somebody
who paid for the original "Rocket Unlocker" I find rather annoying, to say the least.

This Xposed module disables that dialog again, allowing you to use old versions of Rocket Player in
perpetuity (as long as Android itself doesn't break compatibility).

## Compatibility
Should work with all versions of Rocket Player 4 and 5.
